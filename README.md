Anything special?
=================

* gemenv is like virtualenv for ruby gems
* autotitling from zsh and vim (sort of working)
    * zsh - $WHERE
    * vim - $FILENAME
* my gentoo configuration (world file and /etc/portage)
* a{list,pack,unpack}.py = check extension, use the right program
* screen 'sessions' - I use tmux instead of screen now...
